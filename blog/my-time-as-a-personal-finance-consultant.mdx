## What I do.

Sometimes I help people better handle their money. I make them sign an indemnity clause and I charge by the hour.

I first spend a free hour meeting the person and figuring out what the person wants to achieve with their money. Keeping this conversation focused and insult-free is often difficult. Most people I've dealt with seem to not have any idea what they want to achieve - with their money or with their time. After enough probing I can almost always decipher what they actually want. Sometimes it's an early retirement. Other times it's keeping their home.

I then ask them to provide me with documents on every account that they have that involves money. Sometimes this is hundreds of pages. Other times this is less than a dozen pages. Sometimes this involves scouring their home with them looking for bank statements. Every one is different. Sometimes the person can't find the required documents and I can't work with them. Other times it takes weeks between our first meeting and the time they provide me with the required documents. Once I have everything I need I move on to the next step.

I then build a step-by-step guideline on what exactly I would do in their exact situation. I place my psyche as firmly in their world as I can and imagine operating as them. Routinely I will produce to the person hundreds of steps to take to increase the chances of achieving their goal. This takes longer than any other step of the entire process with the person. It involves some basic math and psychology. I present the person with their personal step-by-step guideline at the start of our next meeting.

I then help them with the guideline where they need it. I won't do emergency calls or anything of the sort. I will do half hour phone calls or one hour in person meetings. These calls and meetings are where we evaluate progress, narrow down on any problems, and tie up loose ends.

In a typical month, my total income from all clients is not enough to cover my living expenses.

## How I got here.

I worked in retail management for the better part of a decade. The financial horror stories of my coworkers flabbergasted me. I then grew interested in helping some of them because their problems seemed simple to solve. They weren't.

I read one chapter of one personal finance book and then stared at a wall for a while. In four pages I learned that a seasoned finance professional would consider my own situation if not a horror story then at least a melodrama with a predictably bad ending. Because I studied business in school, took a few courses in finance, and wasn't in debt, I thought that I had things figured out. I knew almost nothing.

So in my typical spirit of not being able to sleep until I thought I knew something, I read several personal finance books. I read and did the math, read and did the math. I got my own finances in order. I got better credit cards and opened tax-advantaged investment accounts. I set up automatic transfers and scheduled my credit card payments to squeeze every last cent of interest that I could from those faceless Bay Street banks.

I walked around with a grin for weeks, dispensing advice to anyone who asked and anyone who didn't. It felt good. In the evenings instead of watching sports I would read about the most obscure edge cases of real estate disputes and probate problems. I then decided that I really wanted to help people handle their money and started the process of making a business case to myself.

I did all the typical incipient small business stuff and made all the mistakes you would expect. Word of mouth helped me eventually work with a healthy handful of clients. I quickly learned that the horror stories of my coworkers were not exclusive to those lucky enough to earn minimum wage. Most people are staggering about thinking that they are the hero of their own story, not realizing that they are actually a demon of unconscious biases, passively squandering their happy futures for quick hits of ephemeral pleasure.

## What I've learned.

The math of personal finance is easy. The psychology of personal finance is hard.

Some people just need help with the arithmetic, the algebra, and some specifics. Others almost surely would benefit from therapy. Money problems mean social problems and social problems mean psychological problems. I don't regret what I've taken on but in this endeavour I certainly didn't expect to learn more about people than about personal finance.

One basic tenet I've learned: every task needs to be as simple and convenient as possible. Whatever step in the process that has historically impeded someone from progress likely needs to be broken down into smaller steps. Sometimes I break tasks down like so: "Pick up the phone and dial 905-867-5309. Wait for the automated voice to present the options. Press 3."

I also learned that no matter how hard I try, there is just so much that is out of my control. Sometimes it's environmental factors, like social things. Sometimes it's economic factors, like the loss of a job.

The most important thing that I learned is that getting people to do things that they aren't used to doing is almost impossible. Consumerism is ingrained in us from a young age, and changing our relationship to our purchases is hard. Solutions like mine are band-aids on society's broken legs. Financial literacy is touted frequently in the news, and I'm all for it in lieu of less transferable skills, but it might be an expedient kludge through which many millions of happy futures continue to fade unrealized.

I'm not going to keep consulting. I'll still help some people around tax time sort out some stuff because it's a tough time of year for some and they could really use the help. Though I'm sure that there are many people out there who would greatly benefit from my help, I think that my time is better spent on bigger things that may be able to help people out even more.
