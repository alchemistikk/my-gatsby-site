### squashed 

I used to help manage retail stores. Over the course of about five years I managed in four different stores for three different brands and directly managed nearly 100 total employees. I was promoted three times.

While working, I studied for and attained two different professional designations in quality management. Upgrading my skills in both math and psychology beyond what I'd learned in my four years at university were fundamental to my development as an operational leader. Quality management when deployed by skillful hands can spark unimaginable change across entire fields. 

Retail management at the store level is not a scientific culture. Opportunities for improvement are difficult to identify. Projects are difficult to define. Data is rare, scattered, and often wrong. In the stores that I worked, for the brands that I worked, I tried to shift the culture to focus on the metrics that I thought mattered. I failed.

It's not that I wasn't given the chances. Many retailers afford store-level managers a degree of control that some might find surprising. No, I failed because I both didn't fight hard enough and didn't have the infrastructure.

### stationary 

Retail employment can be painfully informal. I both hated it and thrived within it. But, I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to turn mildly (un)profitable stores into wildly profitable stores. 

At first, I was lucky. Nearly all of my store managers were supportive. I was allowed to execute small projects with teams of employees. I would pitch my best ideas and was always given complete control. The first part of all my plans was collecting appropriate data.

Automatic data capture works decently well for the marketers at the head office. But, at the store level collecting data doesn't work. Computer interfaces were clunky, slow, wrong, laughable. So, I almost always pivoted to manual data collection (ha). That didn't work either. Customers take priority. Cashiers get rightfully distracted. Salespeople are first and foremost hired to be salespeople, not data collectors. 

Price rules. The margins in retail are often so low that improvement projects are almost never worth the cost. The only reason we were often able to execute these projects is because in the quiet seasons, when you see one customer over the course of five hours, someone has to roam the sales floor. And that someone might as well be doing something somewhat productive. 

I assume that projects were always on the go at a higher level. Marketing campaigns, product purchases, etc. But there are people actually spending dozens of hours each week walking the sales floor, staff who understand the product and it's relationship to customers better than anyone higher up the sales funnel. There are so many intricacies and inefficiencies that they and they alone can fix, but upper management doesn't see it that way. It's just easier to almost never use ideas brought forth from lower-level staff. 

In manufacturing, if staff workers never listened to line workers every factory would close. Retailers ought to have district-or-country-wide full-time store-level quality improvement staff who take the ideas of lower-level staff - retail's version of line workers - seriously. Probe your talent for ideas, because they have them. Most of them will be terrible, but some of them might not be.

### squandered 

It took me nearly five years to realize this pattern. I hopped from store to store, arriving in each new environment believing that I could change things for the better. Once I realized that whatever it took to actually do that I didn't have, I stopped trying.

I think I stayed around for longer than I thought I would because I truly liked the people with whom I worked. The sarcastic wit of disaffected young adults often possesses within it a knowing charm that I will carry with me the rest of my life. Some might describe the atmosphere of store-level retail employment as defeatist, but I don't. There's so much hope and talent waiting to be cultivated, but it takes revolutionary leadership to turn disaffected young adults into potential dynamos. And revolutionary leadership is rare.

Eventually I left retail to start helping people with(out) money, where my hopes had yet to be dashed.
