title: "What to Consume and When to Consume It"

* This is still a rough draft, but I just felt like publishing something since it's been a while.

What to consume: the best stuff. It is extremely likely that one day we will all die, so it's probably best to consume the best while we can.

When to consume it: It's too damn hard to try to figure out exactly the right age or experience you ought to have before consuming some particular piece of art. I just try the best stuff and if it doesn't resonate I think about why and then move on. Great art usually resonates.

Here's specifically what I do.

### The Catalogue

Figure out what it costs to consume the best stuff and then pay it.
For books we go to the library. ($0 / year)
For movies and tv we subscribe to netflix, crave, and amazon prime. (~$350)
	If a particularly compelling piece debuts on another service, we will pay for it for a period. (~$20) We go to the movies about 12-20 times per year. (~$300 - $500)
For music we subscribe to spotify. (~$120)
For games we subscribe to xbox game pass. Some games are also available at our library. (~$120)

Total annual cost: ~$1,000

There are other forms of art worth consuming. For now the above listed categories suffice. Note that we will routinely reevaluate aspects of the catalogue, adding and removing services as we notice trends re: the availability of the best stuff.

### Next Up

Knowing that we're comfortable with the above catalogues of options, to start we went through lists of the best books, movies, tv shows, music, and games and for each category pulled six items that we were interested in (after confirming that we had access to it). We chose six because that's the number of sides on a die and it's the number of 1.5" by 2" sticky notes that fit comfortably on an 8.5" by 11" piece of paper.

On a piece of paper I wrote the numbers 1 through 6 written vertically, with each number taking up ~5 lines. I then on one sticky note at a time write down the name of each movie/game/ etc.

If I feel like reading, and am not currently reading another book, I roll the die, look at the number on the Next Book Up sheet, and then find that number on my reading list and begin to read the book attached to that number.

### Replacement

Once I've selected the next item for consumption, I immediately replace it on the Next Up sheet. I simply again consult a list or two and pick another item to add.

### Loose Ends

In consulting "best of" lists, we routintely come across great items that we've already consumed but don't remember well. In this case we simply add it to the Next Up Sheet. This happens often with albums. The great albums usually take many listens.

If a book is a hot commodity at the library and I only have a week to read it I just read it next. I'm not paying 20 cents per day in late fees.

Some video games take more than 100 hours to complete. Some books are over 1000 pages. Some tv shows have more than 300 episodes. If I'm not into something I just move on. There's always more great stuff out there and I can always return to it later.

Why not just start at the top of the "Best Of" lists and work down? Because it's boring. Randomizing our consumption takes away the agony of choosing and is instead exciting. 

The whole point of this practice is to make us comfortable with the idea that we'll likely get to all the best stuff eventually. Before we had this system I didn't have that comfort. Everything was scattered and deciding on an item was harrowing. Now we just pick, replace, consume, repeat.
